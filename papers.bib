Basically, they fit expression data based on{\ldots} expression data? I still don't get that part. They are using synthetic promoter libraries (not looking at genes). ``The model uses the sequence composition of synthetic promoters to predict their expression levels.''  Okay, I think what's going on here is :
	*	Use sequence + expression of fraction ƒ of promoters to fit parameters. Use those parameters to predict expression in the other 1-ƒ promoters, and compare fit.  
	*	Use sequence + binding of ƒ promoters to fit parameters. Predict binding in the other 1-ƒ
	*	Use sequence + binding + expression of ƒ promoters to fit params. Predict binding + expression in 1-ƒ.
In other words, we are trying to fit a function f(sequence), not f(expression). 

It's not clear that they have any deep biological insights to show from it, but they do turn up a potential competitive binding situation for one of the factors that they do ChIP on.  I think their figure 2 is actually somewhat disappointing: binding doesn't improve expression estimates compared to expression only, and expression doesn't improve binding estimates compared to binding only. It can let you distinguish between competitive and non-competitive models in the case of the ``switching behavior'' of Gcn4.

Perhaps not surprising.  All of these were from adults, not embryos or even juveniles. I would expect the largest differences to show up in brain development during embryogenesis, or at the very latest during the equivalent of adolescence.  Outside of that period, it seems more likely that all the expression is "Maintain the structure you have", whereas it's the actual structural/connectivity changes that are likely to lead to behavioral differences}
